The solution depends on the root cause of the error.  Common solutions include:

1. **Check for XML errors:** Examine all XML files (layouts, drawables, etc.) for any syntax errors.  A single misplaced character or invalid tag can lead to this error.  Use a lint tool or a proper IDE to help validate your XML files.

2. **Verify image formats and sizes:** Ensure that all images used are in a supported format (e.g., PNG, JPG) and have appropriate sizes and densities for different screen resolutions. Invalid image formats can cause resource compilation failures.

3. **Inspect assets:** If you're using custom assets, verify that they are correctly placed in the appropriate `android/app/src/main/res` folders or included in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.  Missing assets might be a reason of this error. 

4. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild of your project can resolve this. In your terminal run `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo build:android --clean`

5. **Check for duplicates:** Verify there are no duplicate resource names (e.g., image names, layout file names) within the application. Duplicate resource names can cause resource compilation conflicts.

6. **Upgrade dependencies:** Ensure that your Expo and related libraries are using their latest versions. Update using `expo upgrade`

Example code illustrating a potential problem (duplicate image names in `res/drawable` causing this issue).  The solution involves fixing these duplicates:

```javascript
// bug.js
// ... code that may use duplicate image names or invalid XML causing the issue
```

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// ...corrected code removing duplicates or fixing the invalid XML to resolve the issue
```
